# Sudoku

A Sudoku is a popular math puzzle of Japanese origin “in which numbers must be arranged within a grid containing several internal squares so that no number is repeated in the same row, column, or internal square” (HarperCollins, n.d.). The aspiration of this project is to produce a web application that can generate Sudokus of varying difficulty and implement an algorithm that can solve them automatically. An intuitive interface will allow users to manually complete generated puzzles as well as enter them so that the
application can determine the solution.

Typically, a Sudoku will exist within a 9x9 grid. However, there are in fact no limits on the size of the grid. A puzzle can be smaller and simpler, or larger and harder to solve. This project will strive to support any size of Sudoku grid, both during the generation and solving of a puzzle.
